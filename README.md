Real Time Facetracker

Trains model to detect faces. When the core application is run,
if your computer has a built-in camera, a pop-up will appear that will
immediately begin labeling faces by making model predictions every frame.

Manually took 116 images and annotated each of them (drew bounding boxes) by marking the face of each image. Used augmentations to produce about 10,000 image.
